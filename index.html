        <h2>What Out of Office Lab Does</h2>
        <p>
          Out of Office Lab is an automation lab for people who want AI to make them money. We build repeatable, no‑touch workflows that turn what you care about into outputs that earn: content, distribution, and promotion that you don’t have to babysit.
        </p>
        <div class="grid-3">
          <div class="card">
            <h3>AI Automation, Not Tools</h3>
            <p>
              We stitch together the latest AI models, agents, and services into pipelines that actually do the work for you instead of giving you yet another dashboard to click around in.
            </p>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>No‑Touch Workflows</h3>
            <p>
              You set the niche, rules, and channels once. The Lab runs the workflows in the background, turning ideas into outputs on a schedule without you manually touching every step.
            </p>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Built to Make Money</h3>
            <p>
              Every workflow is designed around revenue: affiliate clicks, product sales, leads, and deals—not vanity metrics or hobby‑grade content.

        <p>
          Out of Office Lab is a place to turn on engines—not tools. Each engine is a stitched‑together workflow of AI models, agents, and automations that takes an input and produces a money‑focused output with almost no human touch. <!-- [web:620][web:618] -->

        <h2>AI Video Creation &amp; Distribution Engine</h2>
                <p>
          This engine turns a short onboarding questionnaire into a steady stream of videos tailored to your niche, offers, and channels. You answer once, then the engine plans, drafts, and prepares content to go out across YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram. <!-- [web:684][web:685] -->

            <h3>From questions to concepts</h3>
            <p>
              The engine uses your niche, audience, and offer details to generate video concepts and hooks designed to attract the right people, not just more views. <!-- [web:684] -->

      <!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
      <section id="how">
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <h3>Step 1 – Tell Us Your Niche &amp; Offers</h3>
        <p>
          Plug in your niche, audience, and affiliate networks. This gives the engine the boundaries it needs to choose products and angles that fit you.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 2 – Choose Your Automation Level</h3>
        <p>
          Decide how often to post, which channels to use, and how visible you want to be on camera versus faceless AI content.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 3 – Turn On the Engine</h3>
        <p>
          The Lab researches, scripts, generates, and posts videos with your links—on repeat—so you can stay out of the weeds and focus on bigger moves.
