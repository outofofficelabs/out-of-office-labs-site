            After 25 years in cybersecurity, I turned Out of Office Labs into an incubator for low-touch revenue: faceless channels, URL flips, AI desk
            assistants, and systems you can run without clocking in. This is the playbook.

          <h2>Because the people who survived metal slides deserve a softer second act.</h2>
          <p>
            I grew up jumping fences, riding bikes without helmets, and showing up by dinner. That grit carried me through decades of tech leadership—
            but it doesn’t have to define Life 2.0. OOoLabs collects the systems, stacks, and experiments that let us earn well, build things we care
            about, and stay “out of office” whenever we want.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Run experiments: media channels, product flips, AI assistants.</li>
            <li>Share what works—kits, templates, and playbooks so you can copy/paste.</li>
            <li>Offer help for the folks who want it done for them.</li>
